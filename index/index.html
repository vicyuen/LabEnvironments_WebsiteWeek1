				<h1>It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want To Be.</h1>
				<h2>The world's best-selling book by Paul Arden</h2>
				<h3>Phaidon Press Inc.</h3>
					<p><em> It's Not How Good You Are...</em> is a concise guide to making the most of yourself - a pocket 'bible' for the talented and timid to make the unthinkable thinkable and the impossible possible.
After decades at the top of one of the world's most competitive industries,<strong> Paul Arden</strong> offers insights into such diverse subjects as the value of being fired and why it's often better to be wrong than to be right.
He gives original and logical answers to everyday questions. Much of it appears obvious when you read it, but aren't all questions easy when you know the answers?
Whether you are a school-leaver, self-employed or a managing director, this book is invaluable for everyone who aspires to succeed. </p>
